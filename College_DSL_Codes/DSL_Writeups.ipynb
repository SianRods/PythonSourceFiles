    "Here's the detailed writeup for each topic in Python decision-making and control statements with examples for your lab manual:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim:\n",
    "To implement Python programs to demonstrate different decision-making and control statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **if, elif, else Statements**\n",
    "The `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Python allow for decision-making by executing code blocks conditionally. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **if**: Checks a condition and executes its block if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "- **elif**: Stands for \"else if,\" and it allows for additional conditions to be checked if the previous conditions were `False`.\n",
    "- **else**: Executes its block when none of the previous conditions are `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 20\n",
    "if age < 18:\n",
    "    print(\"Minor\")\n",
    "elif age >= 18 and age < 60:\n",
    "    print(\"Adult\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Senior Citizen\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: Here, the program categorizes a person based on age. If the age is below 18, \"Minor\" is printed. If it’s between 18 and 60, \"Adult\" is printed, and if it's above 60, \"Senior Citizen\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **for Loops**\n",
    "The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, or string) and perform operations on each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sum = 0\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    sum += num\n",
    "print(\"Sum:\", sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: This example calculates the sum of elements in the list `numbers`. The `for` loop iterates over each number, adding it to `sum`, which is printed at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **while Loops**\n",
    "The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Count is:\", count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: The `while` loop here prints the value of `count` as long as it’s less than 5. After each print, `count` is incremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **break, continue, pass**\n",
    "- **break**: Terminates the loop and exits the code block.\n",
    "- **continue**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration in the loop.\n",
    "- **pass**: Acts as a placeholder, doing nothing when encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    elif i == 1:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: This `for` loop prints values from 0 to 4 but skips printing 1 (due to `continue`) and stops the loop entirely when `i` equals 3 (due to `break`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "In Python, control statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loop structures (`for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`) provide powerful ways to control the flow of a program. By mastering these constructs, one can create efficient and conditional workflows for various programming needs."

    "To understand the concept of string data types, learn how to create and manipulate strings in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Introduction to Python Strings**\n",
    "A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed within single (`'...'`) or double (`\"...\"`) quotes. Strings are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be changed directly. Python provides a rich set of functions and methods for string manipulation, making it a versatile data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: Here, a string `\"Hello, World!\"` is assigned to the variable `message` and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Creating and Accessing Strings**\n",
    "Strings can be created by enclosing text in quotes. Individual characters within a string can be accessed using indexing, and ranges of characters can be accessed using slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Python Programming\"\n",
    "print(\"First character:\", text[0])      # Accessing first character\n",
    "print(\"Last character:\", text[-1])      # Accessing last character\n",
    "print(\"Substring:\", text[0:6])          # Accessing substring\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: The string `\"Python Programming\"` is stored in `text`. Using indexing, we access the first (`text[0]`), last (`text[-1]`), and a substring (`text[0:6]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Performing Basic Operations on Strings**\n",
    "Python supports various operations on strings, such as concatenation, repetition, length calculation, and common methods like `lower()`, `upper()`, and `replace()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Data\"\n",
    "field = \"Science\"\n",
    "full_name = name + \" \" + field       # Concatenation\n",
    "print(\"Concatenated String:\", full_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "repeated = name * 3                  # Repetition\n",
    "print(\"Repeated String:\", repeated)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Uppercase:\", name.upper())    # Convert to uppercase\n",
    "print(\"Length:\", len(name))          # Calculate length\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: Here, two strings `name` and `field` are concatenated using `+`, repeated with `*`, converted to uppercase, and the length of `name` is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of Strings in Data Science and Statistics\n",
    "In data science and statistics, strings are crucial for handling and analyzing textual data. They are widely used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**: Strings can be manipulated to remove unwanted characters or spaces, convert text to a standard format (e.g., lowercase), or replace substrings.\n",
    "2. **Parsing and Extracting Information**: Strings are essential for parsing data files, processing JSON or XML data, and extracting relevant information for analysis.\n",
    "3. **Data Visualization**: Labels, titles, and legends in plots often require string manipulation to ensure clarity and formatting.\n",
    "4. **Text Analysis**: In natural language processing, strings are analyzed for sentiment, topic, and language patterns using string methods and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Aim:\n",
    "To understand and utilize Python collections (lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries) and explore their applications in data science and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Lists**\n",
    "A list is an ordered, mutable collection of elements. Lists can store elements of different data types and allow duplicate entries. Lists are highly flexible and commonly used to store sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits.append(\"orange\")         # Adding an element\n",
    "print(\"List of fruits:\", fruits)\n",
    "print(\"First fruit:\", fruits[0]) # Accessing an element by index\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: A list `fruits` is created with initial elements, and `append()` is used to add another element. The first element is accessed by indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Tuples**\n",
    "A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection, meaning that once created, elements cannot be changed. Tuples are useful for storing data that should not be modified and are often used for fixed datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dimensions = (10, 20, 30)\n",
    "print(\"Dimensions:\", dimensions)\n",
    "print(\"Length:\", len(dimensions))    # Getting the length of tuple\n",
    "print(\"First dimension:\", dimensions[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: A tuple `dimensions` stores fixed values. We access elements by indexing and get the tuple's length using `len()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Sets**\n",
    "A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicates and are ideal for situations where uniqueness is essential. They support various mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}\n",
    "print(\"Set of unique numbers:\", unique_numbers)  # Duplicate '3' is removed\n",
    "unique_numbers.add(5)\n",
    "print(\"Updated set:\", unique_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: A set `unique_numbers` is created, where duplicate values are automatically removed. The `add()` method adds a new element to the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Dictionaries**\n",
    "A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and values can be of any type. Dictionaries are used to store and access data based on unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "student = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 22, \"grade\": \"A\"}\n",
    "print(\"Student's name:\", student[\"name\"])        # Accessing value by key\n",
    "student[\"age\"] = 23                              # Modifying a value\n",
    "print(\"Updated dictionary:\", student)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: The dictionary `student` stores information with keys like `\"name\"` and `\"age\"`. We access and modify values by referring to these keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of Collections in Data Science and Statistics\n",
    "In data science and statistics, collections play a crucial role in handling data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lists** are commonly used to store data sequences and iterate through records in data processing tasks.\n",
    "2. **Tuples** are used to represent fixed sets of data points, such as coordinates or dimensions.\n",
    "3. **Sets** are useful for handling unique items, such as unique values in a column or unique categories.\n",
    "4. **Dictionaries** are essential for organizing data in a key-value format, enabling efficient data retrieval by unique identifiers (e.g., mapping feature names to values).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "Python collections (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries) provide diverse data structures suited to various tasks in data science and statistics. Each collection has unique properties, allowing effective data management, storage, and manipulation. Understanding these structures enables efficient data handling and enhances analytical workflows."

    "### Aim:\n",
    "To understand and apply functions and recursion in Python programming and explore their usefulness in solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Introduction to Functions**\n",
    "A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions help organize code, make it more readable, and facilitate code reuse. Python functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "greet()\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: This function `greet` prints a greeting message when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Function Parameters and Return Values**\n",
    "Functions can accept inputs (parameters) and can return values. Parameters allow functions to process dynamic data, and the `return` statement provides output back to the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "print(\"Sum:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: The function `add` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, adds them, and returns the result. The returned value is stored in `result` and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Introduction to Recursion**\n",
    "Recursion occurs when a function calls itself within its definition. Recursive functions solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable sub-problems, often leading to elegant solutions for problems involving repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Recursive Function Examples**\n",
    "A classic example of recursion is the calculation of the factorial of a number, where the factorial of `n` is defined as `n * factorial(n-1)` for `n > 0`, with the base case being `factorial(0) = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Factorial of 5:\", factorial(5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: The `factorial` function calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case `n == 0`, at which point it returns 1. This produces the factorial of 5, calculated as `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Practical Applications**\n",
    "Functions and recursion are highly useful in programming and problem-solving. Some practical applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Processing**: Functions allow modular code, making data processing tasks cleaner and reusable.\n",
    "- **Mathematics**: Recursive functions efficiently solve mathematical problems like computing the Fibonacci sequence or factorials.\n",
    "- **Sorting and Searching**: Recursive algorithms like quicksort and binary search are essential in data science and computer science.\n",
    "- **Tree Traversal**: Recursive functions traverse data structures such as trees and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "Functions and recursion in Python allow for efficient problem-solving and code reusability. By using parameters and return values, functions make code dynamic and modular. Recursion provides a powerful technique for solving repetitive tasks through self-referential functions, making it especially useful in algorithms and mathematical computations. Understanding these concepts is fundamental for developing structured and effective Python programs."

    "**Explanation**: This example demonstrates basic string operations, including concatenating two strings, extracting a substring (slicing), and calculating the string’s length.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **String Methods**\n",
    "Python offers numerous string methods, such as `lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, and `split()`, which are used for common text transformations and cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sentence = \"  Machine Learning is powerful!  \"\n",
    "print(\"Lowercase:\", sentence.lower())            # Convert to lowercase\n",
    "print(\"Stripped:\", sentence.strip())             # Remove leading/trailing whitespace\n",

    "print(\"Split:\", sentence.split())                # Split into words\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: These examples demonstrate text manipulation by converting to lowercase, removing whitespace, replacing a word, and splitting the text into individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Regular Expressions Basics**\n",
    "Regular expressions (regex) provide a powerful way to search, match, and manipulate strings based on patterns. Regular expressions use special syntax to define search patterns, enabling complex text searches and modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "pattern = r\"\\d+\"   # Pattern to find one or more digits\n",

    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(\"Numbers found:\", matches)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: Here, `re.findall()` uses a regex pattern `\\d+` (one or more digits) to find and return all digit sequences in the text. The result is a list of numbers found in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Regular Expressions for Text Processing**\n",
    "Regular expressions can be used in text processing tasks, such as finding specific patterns, validating strings, and extracting data from unstructured text. Common functions include `re.search()`, `re.match()`, and `re.sub()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Contact us at support@example.com or sales@example.com\"\n",
    "emails = re.findall(r\"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\", text)\n",
    "print(\"Emails found:\", emails)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: The regex pattern here matches email addresses, identifying both email addresses in the text using `re.findall()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications:\n",
    "Text processing and regular expressions have wide applications in data science, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**: Regex is used to identify and remove unwanted patterns, such as special characters and whitespace, in text data.\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant information, such as dates, emails, or phone numbers, from text data.\n",
    "3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Text processing is essential in sentiment analysis, where text is tokenized, cleaned, and prepared for modeling.\n",
    "4. **Information Retrieval**: Regex patterns can help identify and filter relevant information from large text datasets, making it easier to perform data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "Text processing and regular expressions are fundamental for working with text data. String methods and regex allow for powerful data cleaning, extraction, and manipulation.

    "#### 1. **Difference Between Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming**\n",
    "- **Procedural Programming**: This paradigm is based on functions or procedures, where the program is divided into reusable functions. It follows a top-down approach and is suitable for simple applications. Data and functions are separate, and data can be accessed from any function.\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Programming**: This paradigm structures code by bundling data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together into \"objects.\" It follows a bottom-up approach and is suitable for complex applications. OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "In OOP, an `Employee` class could encapsulate both employee data and functions related to an employee, whereas in procedural programming, employee data and functions would be handled separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Features of OOP**\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods within classes to restrict direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: A mechanism for creating a new class from an existing class, allowing reuse of code and the extension of functionalities.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, supporting multiple implementations.\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Fundamental Concepts of OOP in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (instances). A class defines attributes and methods.\n",
    "- **Object**: An instance of a class, representing a specific entity with attributes and behaviors defined by the class.\n",
    "- **Method**: A function defined within a class that operates on the data contained in the object.\n",

    "**Explanation**: The `Car` class defines a template for car objects with attributes `brand` and `model`, and a method `display_info` to print details. `car1` is an object of the `Car` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Encapsulation**\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class to restrict access to certain components. In Python, we use underscore prefixes (e.g., `_attribute`) to indicate private attributes and methods, which should not be accessed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Account:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "account = Account(1000)\n",
    "account.deposit(500)\n",
    "print(\"Balance:\", account.get_balance())\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: Here, `__balance` is a private attribute, accessible only through methods like `deposit` and `get_balance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Inheritance**\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse and hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a generic sound.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):  # Inheriting from Animal\n",
    "    def sound(self):  # Overriding method\n",
    "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.sound()  # Output: Bark\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: `Dog` inherits from `Animal` but overrides the `sound` method to provide a more specific implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated through a common interface, often using method overriding or polymorphic functions that work on multiple data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def animal_sound(animal):\n",
    "    animal.sound()\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "animal_sound(cat)   # Output: Meow\n",
    "animal_sound(dog)   # Output: Bark\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: The `animal_sound` function can accept any object that has a `sound` method, allowing polymorphic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming in Python provides a robust way to structure code by encapsulating data and functionality within objects. By leveraging classes, objects, and core concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, OOP promotes modular, reusable, and efficient code. Understanding these concepts enables the development of complex applications with clear, manageable, and maintainable code structure."
