# Basically There are two Loops in Python 
# 1] While -Loop 
# 2]Do-While Loop

# Syntax of the While Loop 
# while(condition):
#     # Iterating Blocks 

i=0
while(i<=10):
    print(i*2)
    i=i+1
    
# Using For Loop 
# Iterating through lists : 
l=[32,4,25,543]
for item in l:
    print(item)
# Notice that all the Data Types Such as Lists , Tuples , String --> iterables 

#  Using For-Loop with the Range Function ;

for i in range(0,11):
    print(i)

# Note that the upper limit is excluded 

# Using For-Loop With Else 
# Here the Else is Executed once For-Loop is Exited 
lis=[2432,325234,543,5]
for item in lis:
    print(item)
