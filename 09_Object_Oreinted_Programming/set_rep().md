In Python, the `__str__()` and `__repr__()` methods are both used to define how objects of a class are represented as strings, but they serve different purposes.

### 1. `__str__()`: For a Readable or Informal String Representation
- **Purpose**: The `__str__()` method is meant to return a **human-readable** string that is easy to interpret. It’s typically used for creating an output that is meant for end-users.
- **Usage**: When you use the `print()` function or call `str()` on an object, Python internally calls `__str__()` to get the string representation.

**Example:**
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}"

car = Car("Tesla", "Model S")
print(car)  # Output: Tesla Model S
```

### 2. `__repr__()`: For a Precise or Formal String Representation
- **Purpose**: The `__repr__()` method is meant to return a string that would ideally allow someone to recreate the object if passed to `eval()`. It’s intended for debugging and development. The output is often more technical or precise.
- **Usage**: When you use the `repr()` function or when you evaluate an object in the interactive interpreter, Python calls `__repr__()`.

**Example:**
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Car('{self.make}', '{self.model}')"

car = Car("Tesla", "Model S")
print(repr(car))  # Output: Car('Tesla', 'Model S')
```

### Key Differences:
- **Audience**: `__str__()` is for users (readable), and `__repr__()` is for developers (precise).
- **Fallback**: If `__str__()` is not defined, Python will fall back on `__repr__()` for `print()` and `str()`.
